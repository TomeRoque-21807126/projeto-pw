    <p><b><i>Meet Tomé Roque.</i></b> Programmer & Editor <br><br>
    Hey there! As you already know, my name is Tomé Roque. A small town boy who grew up to take a degree in computer science
      while also having a passion for photo and video editing, having been involved in projects on both matters. <br>
      Living in a world where people should enjoy what they do, I also make some of my own work mainly for fun purposes.
